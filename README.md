> Repository storing the codebase required for the takehome test (2weeks)

# Takehome Solution
The intructions for this takehome test can be found in the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) file.

## Folder Organisation

In this root directory you will find several directories

* `terraform` stores the necessary scripts to recreate the serving environment.
* `helm-charts` stores the helm chart to deploy the Âµservice _geoapi_.
* `precompute` stores the scripts to generate the data served by the APIs
* `notebook` stores EDA to understand the tables
* `components` stores the code base for the different parts of the api eg. the python flask app. Other future components eg. databases, cache, message queues, etc can be stored here.
